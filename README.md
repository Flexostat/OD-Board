# OD-Board
This repository contains the optical density measurement PCB and firmware source
 and production files for the Flexostat and syphonstat.

### Production_files/PCB/
These are the files that get zipped and sent to the PCB fabricator.

### Production_files/firmware.hex
This is the firmware file to be loaded onto the OD board.  

### seeed_bom.csv
This is the BOM file used by Seeedstudio to assemble the PCB.  If assembled by
Seeedstudio, the light sensors still need to be added afterwards since seeed
does not stock them.
